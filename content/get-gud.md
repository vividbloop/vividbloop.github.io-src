Relative A seems to follow cultural precepts too easily.

Without critical thinking, he glorifies whatever is being glorified as new or cool at the moment.

For instance, Smash.

"How can you enjoy it without knowing advanced tech? It can't be fun being crushed every match."

This, to me, demonstrates a basic misunderstanding of what games are for.

Im sure if I said that to him, he'd parrot to me some principles in his game design textbook or that he read on a nicely designed blog.

Relative B has very keen critical thinking, but lacks solidity.

He adapts his demeanor and opinions to bend to whoever's next to him in the room.

There is a lot of real world knowledge that I didn't get growing up.

I'm trying to get it by hanging out with more people now.

Even though I feel successful when I acquire it, the aims of such knowledge become more and more suspect to me as time goes on.

For instance, tips on how to game the system. Avoiding tax by putting in another address. Choosing a technical career to max out income. Not telling your employer you're seeking another job. Selecting neighborhoods to optimize for lifestyle and "bringing dates back".

What's popular now to meet new people, nightclubs, activities. Cultural touchstones at the moment, this rap artist, that game.

What is it all for?

The ease to which my relatives fit into their respective groups, slot into life - I envied that ease.

But there seems to me a surfeit of <i>things</i>, and a lack of <i>feeling</i>.
