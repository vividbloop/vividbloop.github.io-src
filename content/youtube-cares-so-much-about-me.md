Summary: And this is how they won...

One of the reasons we have let algorithms take over much of our daily
 thinking is because we are actually pleased to have someone (a service) take
  so much interest in us. Me. When's the last time your loved one gave you a
   mixtape? Bet they don't do it daily. Yet my vanity is stroked when YouTube
    cares so much about me to understand my nuanced tastes and sift through
     the heaps of postrock to bring me songs that are 25% rock, 25
     % progressive metal, 25% orchestral, and 25% ambient. It knows my
      preferred BPM. And this is how they won, through marketing that felt
       like love.
