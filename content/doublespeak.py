Summary: It's everywhere, don't worry.

"Uncover":
A NYC library would never, upon pain of death, display essays written by conservative thinkers like Thomas Sowell.

"Enjoy":
Within the locus of politically righteous materials, the number of well written things is scarce, and so you see the inflated worth of certain books because they adhere to the desired ideology, or an influx of mediocre minority writers.

"Go":
Despite carrying books like "Practicing for the GED" or "python crash course", the actual consuners at libraries are likely old Chinese men reading Chinese newspapers bought in the deli across the street, vagrants, or tweens playing online games.

"Investigate":
The foolish notion that reading books somehow makes or shows that you are a critical thinker.
