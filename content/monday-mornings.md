Summary: On the subway...

Monday morning exhaustion is so unnatural.

When you're attuned to the rest of the world, you notice that the sun shines as brightly as it does on every other day of the week.

But in a subway car, all that's around you are worn out faces.

When we should be bright and energized, we're locked into our own misery, or our little escape devices.
