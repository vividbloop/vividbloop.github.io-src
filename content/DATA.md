Summary: ALL ABOUT THAT DATUM

What is a great advance in tech in the past century?

An answer I have that probably many others wont (but some will) is this: the standardization of data formats.

I now have 30+ packets of sheet music.

I've thought of different ways to organize then, some pretty (and expensive), and others lousy (and free - cough mooching binders from work cough).

As I was thumbing through this collection that now resembles more a manual than sheet music, I thought of how lucky I was that every transcriptor had abided to the Western system, treble on top and bass on bottom, 5 lines each; that this distribution platform (Musescore) enforced this and also was able to reshape this data to fit 8.5x11 paper. 

Some people actually enjoy the novelty of different formats; some might like collecting for instance Chinese harp music (which forgoes circles as notes and uses numerals instead), I was once even taught Indian religious singing and told sternly that passing this down as a written record was not the way.

Standardized data, whether you're talking about open access protocols, data management best practice, ASCII, or sheet music, has made life ineffably easier.
