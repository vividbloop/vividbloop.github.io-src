Summary: *weird whizzing noises*

There's this guy in Futurama. Pedantic. Always wanting to cross the t's and dot the i's. Loves paperwork!
So, is this true of government officials?
We all come in a spectrum. But yes.
Within the Ivy League cadre, I've come across graduates who are enamored with filling out the dittos we receive from upper management.
I mean, these are the most bullshit, stolen from the 3rd grade homeroom materials, progress sheets that essentially ask you to tell them how your goals "align with our goals", which is basically [random Girl Scout character trait].
Another example: a graduate who can't explain anything without referring to the most politically correct definition which always fails to elucidate, who (I kid you not) jokes there are rules and processes for this! (big laugh)..for pretty much any topic.
I've been asked to write a binder of documentation for... using an app.
Yes.
I've' formatted and printed out instructions detailing how to Save As... in Excel.
Like, where to click your mouse.
In the ribbon.
When I wrote it, I thought, there's no way in hell anyone would actually use this.
You mistake just how pedantic the government can get.
I had to watch as one executive lead asked another, how do I use this, and the other executive pulled out this printed, heavily commented on document, and exclaimed "read the documentation!"
