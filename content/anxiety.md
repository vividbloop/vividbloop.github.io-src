Summary: :(

For the past year I've found it pretty difficult to get mental peace.

I tried all sorts of things, like stretching, mindfulness etc.

What kept me going through discomfort/agony (depending on the day) was the dream of a life <i>other than this one</i>.

I found my daily life to be unbearable.

I felt like I had no future.

I predicted I would feel this way upon getting my first full time job.

When that feeling encroaches on me, I feel like I'd do anything to escape, kind of like how a drug addict might feel.

It's the feeling that on my tombstone they will write "and she made Excel reports." That because I'm quasi married, I'll never get to experience romance again, I won't have the chance for The Great Romance that apparently elevates my life to some other plane otherwise inaccessible. That my possibilities shred like zucchini in a processor.

The physical symptoms match up with anxiety, and I have concluded:

I have anxiety about having a dead end life.

I was about to type boring, but that's not quite it.

I am OK with a boring life that will lead somewhere unexpected. I can endure it.

I'm not OK with my days being written out for me, each page a day, and me just flipping through what has already been known.

The reason why I say anxiety is because it's just so far from reality.

In the past year, I've went to places and learned things that blew my mind.

Since me and K started our relationship, I continue to grow, the circumference of my freedom is still quite good, and yes - I still experience romance.

So it's not like having a job and an LRT freezes you in place.

But I'm <i>still</i> anxious.

And there are some things I'm legitimately anxious about - getting fired, paying rent, K getting fired, K paying rent, the looming future of our in laws and their desires, people yelling at me for unwarranted reasons at work, etc.

But mostly I'm anxious that my youth is gone.

I'm anxious I can never recover it.

That I went into another room, the room of Middle Age, but some of my friends are still in the Youth room, and I fear I can't join them (and I'm jealous - why do they get to stay there? But I also look down on them, a little.)

I feel trapped and I know I'm not trapped but <i>knowing</i> doesn't help the pressure on my ribs.
