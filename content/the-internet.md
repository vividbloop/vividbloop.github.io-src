Summary: In a word, no...

I was making desultory swipes on my phone. Trying to think: "Where can I get
 more content like this sweet cat pic background I currently have?" I found
  myself wishing for a central repository of interesting, obscure such
   snippets... bemoaning the fact that I'd need to buy a magazine from Japan
   , talk to my friend plugged in the art scene, and somehow tap into the
    meme rich but also incel piss drenched corners of the internet. And then
     I thought - "that was the <u>promise</u> of the internet, an easy, one
      stop shop to get these things." And yet, the internet is failing me, as
       most users use it - with Google as their primary tool of discovery
       . This was the problem I sought to solve with my shitty little Java
        "program". Seeing as how it's now been a year since I "developed
        " this, I might look into rewriting it as a mobile app. (Though, I
         also made it with a e s t h e t i c images in mind - I'd need to
          broaden that taste to include more of the kinds of things I like to
           browse nowadays.)
      
A Wayback Machine recommender algorithm! That's what we need.

YouTube is doing something interesting with their algorithm; as a metonym for
 quality they seem to filter only for HD videos. I wonder if that would be a
  good approach; easy enough for pictures, but what about mixed content like
   a webpage?
