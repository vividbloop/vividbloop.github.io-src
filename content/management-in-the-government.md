Summary: Stupidity.

I hate one of the "directors" here and his dirty tactics.

Generally, I don't respect anyone whose sole reason for me to do something is
 "because I'm your boss."
 
If you don't have a better reason than that, fuck you.

I'll do something because it's critical to operations, or because it improves
 efficiency, within a reasonable timeframe.

I'll do something because it helps the team at large.

What I will not be happy about doing is something that helps *only* you
 because you're 1. lazy or 2. stupid.

I also will not be happy about doing something if I resist and you <i>insist
</i>, pulling your rank over me.

Today I was looking at a report with aforementioned person. I said I wasn't
 sure about one of the data fields and moved my mouse to investigate
 . He started saying, "no, we need to look at something else," I
  basically was going to be done in two seconds, but then he rapidly
   said "I've been here for a long time. You have to trust me on this. I know
    what I'm doing" and without giving me the time to respond, basically
     ejected me out of my fucking chair.

(Postscript: he doesn't know what he's doing because today was a windfall of
 a problem that he was supposed to solve back in September.)
 
(Postpostscript: he has pushed me, in ways that would seem rude to observers
, to give data that I knew could be wrong in certain aspects, and despite
 me saying repeatedly that this method was not good, seemed surprised when IT WAS WRONG.)
 
If you are going to appeal to authority, you better be ready for me to appeal
 to minority. I hate pulling this kind of shit, but if you're giving me that
  speech like "do you know who's in charge here?", I'm going to say this right
   back at you: "I feel really uncomfortable with your tone right now
   ." Loudly. Cause you know what today's ultra liberal universe points
    fingers at the most? White men making minorities/the powerless feel
     uncomfortable. (By the way, this guy is in our racial equity committee
     ! More on that later.)

I think playing victim is one of the pettiest things you can do, but the
 *pettiest* thing you can certainly do is override other people's judgements
  and physical space simply because of your *position*, which isn't a fucking
   real thing.

Later on, this person had the disgusting shamelessness to ask me to build a
 report in 1 hour to be used legitimately, at most, for 9 hours. I just
  gawked at him. You do know about something called a "build test debug
  " cycle right? Do you realize that things, accurate, fast things, can't
   just be built in the snap of a finger or because you <i>want</i> them? He is
    completely capable, too, of pulling various sources together to get the
     information he needs. <i>He just wanted a one button solution</i>. Yeah, I'm
      going to work overtime on <i>Chinese New Year's</i> so that you don't have
       to have to goddamned <i>headache</i> of interacting with GUIs from 3
        different platforms! Wow! How difficult! Anyway, I parroted his
         request back at him to emphasize how ridiculous he was - and how
          insulting it was for him to treat me like a personal servant/slave
          /widget - but I don't think he got it. I actually don't think he
           got it.

The appropriate way to do this is when I hold a meeting about this very thing, to
 inform me of requests of things you might want <i>2 months in advance</i>.

(We host meetings to get feedback, he doesn't come (because why would he give
 a shit about coming to a meeting where he's a mandatory attendee? why would
  he be respectful of an appropriate partitioning of tasks, or your time
  ?), he blames me 2 months later, etc.)
 
Will he ever learn?

<i>No</i>.

Other things he does:
* Look at his phone while you're talking to him. It's as though you're just
 vapor. You just have to awkwardly trail off.
* Respond to an email while you're talking to him. He's not going to glance
 back up at you, so you just kind of have to leave.
* Only smile at you when he wants something.
* Be a big baby; <i>pound the desk</i>
* Be "the ring of inefficiency that is holding our entire office back. Maybe
 the nation" (quote from myself a year ago)
 
Something else he's done, that I've only ever seen my autistic 30 year old
 cousin still living with his parents do:
 
Once, I was showcasing a new report, where you could click on a box and it
 would show you a dropdown of possible selections. You're probably rereading the
  last sentence and going "huh" because using this <i>feature</i> is so basic
  , if a kid couldn't do this, we actually would label him as needing disability
   accommodations. I thought I was overexaggerating with my autistic cousin
    comparison, but maybe not. This director looks at the data validated
     field with a furrowed brow, turns to my manager afterwards and sighs
     , "change is hard." While I'm in the same room.

Yes, he complained about my product while <i>I was in the same room, to
 another person</i>, so that I could overhear him, but so that he wouldn't have
  to say it to me directly.

I understand that in tech, I'd have to deal with sexual harrassment and
 arrogant PhDs who refuse to use libs written by anyone else and bros who
  actually believe in agile/jira/<i>slack</i> and weeaboos who jerk off to
   anime figurines.

Sometimes, I believe that would be a better fate for me than having to spend
 another second of my life with this director.
