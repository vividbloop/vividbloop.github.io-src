Summary: Murica...

I had a discussion with a couple of colleagues about a trend that scares me
 deeply.
 
I've noticed in small towns in the Midwest, there can be an
 antiintellectualist strand. Sometimes it's pronounced, like parents saying
 , "Why should I send my kid to college? What's the use of college
 ?" Sometimes it's a little bit more subtle, like a college educated kid from
  these parts choosing to disengage from highly theoretical conversations.

I'll go into both examples in a little bit more detail. One of my colleagues
 (one of these young, naive, idealist types - but so cute!) pointed out that
  people have the right to live however they choose, and isn't it valid for a
   family to just want a decent paying job close to where they grew up?

This is the kind of reasoning that makes me very angry. Because I've been
 there before. I've been that young, naive idealist, and I also know that I'm
  at the most dangerous place to be - I'm not complete ignorant of such
   families (like my colleague) which would let me blithely bestow good luck
    on them, but I also haven't walked a mile in their shoes. I'm at the
     halfway house of having a small bit of knowledge - so small, really
      - but enough for me to, apparently, believe in my expertise on the
       subject. Again, a dangerous place to be.
   
In the final book of the trilogy The Three Body Problem, an esteemed
scientist is rounded up and stoned by communists. After I read that scene
, I had a nightmare about some young military men in camo knocking on the
 door of my childhood home, where me and my mom were. Hunting us down
  because we'd been exposed to Western beliefs. Coming in the name of
   nationalism, in the name of progress, to detain us, having a target on
    our backs for my mom's PhD.

So, "anti-intellectualism" holds a very different ring for me than it
might to a white person. I carry that fear of this starting all over
 again, except now in Arkansas, not Mao Zedong's China.

To go back to the examples:

Kendall's father had asked me, "What's the point of college?"

"To increase your earnings."

"But I earn XXX.XXX at the post office. I don't have a degree. There's guys
who graduated with degrees in Criminology making the same as me."

Fine. This is valid.

"To pursue your dreams. If Kendall wants to research veterinary biology, that
's impossible without a degree."

"I never thought of a job as pursuing my dreams. It's just a way to support
 my family. Hell, I hate my job!"
 
Fine. That's valid too, I guess.

"For the connections. There are some doors that you can't open until you're
 at a good college. There are some circles that are just unlocked."

"Why would we want our son in these circles?"

THERE. There it is.

<i>We don't want them! We don't like them! Our son's not like them!</i>

<b>Progress can never come to a community where intellectuals are the enemy.</b>

And now for the next example:

I have a good friend from there (I think, he might not actually consider me a
 friend) who is easily among the 2 friends I have in the world I consider an
  intellectual equal.

But outside the topics that fall under his major (computer science), he
 resolutely refuses to engage in any theoretical discussion of • math
  • social issues • gameplay design... In a way that seems to imply, "it's <u>stupid</u> to think deeply."

I think one really good illustration of this is when I asked him about the
 nature of data. Paraphrasing: "I'm really interested in information theory
 . What is data, how it is interpreted? Why did I once read about an
  information theory professor holding up two paintings, one just blue sky
   and the other a Song dynasty, richly detailed tapestry, and say the blue
    sky held more information than the Song one? What are the physical laws
     that bound our understanding our data?"
 
 "Simple. Data is anything we can collect data on."
 
 And while this answer is... <i>sufficient</i>, there's also this extreme
  sense of importance, of superiority, in this je ne sais quoi attitude
  . Almost like, "theory is <u>stupid</u>." And I know his family, and I know
   his town, and I know that this attitude is what keeps him well-liked. It's
    all-American to give an answer that cuts to the chase, yes, but that also
     flattens all nuance and derides insightful thinking as <u>stupid</u>.
