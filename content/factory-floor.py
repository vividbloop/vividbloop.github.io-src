"No. Theyre not allowed to take breaks."

Can you imagine a workplace where you're constantly being watched for evidence of idleness - where an overlong bathroom break could subject you to firing?
I have to watch my colleagues construct a draconian maze for the people working for us.
While we do nothing in the face of a real problem, which is, our institutions being too lazy to learn how to take over the whole sequence of events needed to administer public services - while we rush to save their asses every year, failing to address the underlying problem at hand - we nitpick individuals over stuff that doesnt actually matter. We strip away human dignity in the name of *minutes*. Not even hours, but minutes.
