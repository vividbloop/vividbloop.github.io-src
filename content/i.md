Summary: I'm in a bullshit job...

Interviewing this Harvard candidate today left me with so many mixed feelings.

I don't have the same heart I came into this work with.

I'm no longer looking to herald in the next data engineering innovation, push
 my knowledge of programming further, or treat work as an escape.
 
In other words, I don't look <u>down</u> on the stupid, drag + drop 100 files
 into 100 different folders, tedium, the equivalent of data janitorial work
  anymore.
  
And the fact that I no longer equate the <u>type</u> of work I do with my
 potential, is what lessened my hatred of work.
 
"Shoveling snow."

That's what Murakami said every job amounted to in the end.

And to see a ~70 year old with this same, snobby attitude as myself as a 22
-year-old - makes me feel <u>really</u> disappointed. Because there's nothing
 in the Ivy League curriculum, no stop on the 120+ IQ pipeline, where this
  point is hammered home. Everyone else like me <u>thinks they're too good</u>
  . (And the scary part is when people accept this consensus, and it becomes
   social reality - when people defer to this man, and believe the smell of
    the room is indeed as repugnant as his wrinkled nose makes it appear.)

Some of the concerns we had about this candidate:
    I have the feeling he's going to go rogue, and that he just wants to get
     closer to the data for self-serving reasons.
    Does he just want to write an expos√©?
    Will he find the work intellectually stimulating enough?
    
The idea: is there too much "I" in this candidate?

Can this candidate <i>serve</i>?

But isn't this a question for all of us?

Don't we all, on some degree or another, have our own personal vested
 interests we silently click, mouth words to, culminating in a destination
  only we want?

Does he only appear revolting to me because I see myself in him?

And what does this mean about my colleagues, who don't share this same
 sensitivity to ego, to id?
